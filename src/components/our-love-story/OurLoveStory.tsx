                  When I set my eyes on Wife on that day, I had a
                  never-felt-before feeling, I couldn&apos;t stop asking myself
                  who this beautiful lady was and I didn&apos;t waste any time
                  in making the necessary move. After a series of communications
                  with God and a couple of conversations with her, I became
                  further convinced she was the one. Her zeal for the things of
                  the Lord was stronger than mine :)
                </p>
                <p>
                  It&apos;s been a special and beautiful ride. Like Shania Twain
                  said:{' '}

                  On the first day when John approached me, I didn&apos;t like
                  him a bit. I neither wanted to talk to him nor agree to be his
                  friend because he wasn&apos;t my type. Funny right? I know,
                  haha.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I tried my best to avoid him, but it seemed like he was in a
                  special agreement with the Lord to arrest my mind. Fast
                  forward to weeks later... I wish I had accepted him earlier
                  because he turned out to be the quintessential lover; his
                  gentle but disciplined personality, humorous and sweet aura,
                  coupled with his intelligence, captured my heart.
                </p>
                <p>Every woman should pray to have an Ol√° in their life!</p>
